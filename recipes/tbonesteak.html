        <h1>Description</h1>
        <p> Crosscut from the forward section of the short loin on a steer's middle back, a T-bone steak 
            contains a strip of the top loin and a chunk of tenderloin, both desired cuts on their own. 
            A T-shaped bone from the lumbar separates the two pieces.</p>
        <p>The T-bone combines the meaty flavor of a strip steak, often called a New York strip when it's
             sold on its own, with the signature tenderness of the filet mignon.</p>
