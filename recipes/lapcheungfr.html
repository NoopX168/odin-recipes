        <h1>Description</h1>
        <p> Chinese sweet sausage is very common in Cantonese cuisine. It has a savory, sweet and 
            smoky flavor profile. This dish takes very little time. 
        </p>
        <p>There are several types of delicious Asian cured sausage, but my favorite is the 
            Cantonese-style sweet sausage. It has a red-ish color and it comes in refrigerated packages. This Chinese sausage fried rice recipe works really well with sweet sausage.</p>
